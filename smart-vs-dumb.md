## Container Components or Smart Components (The Behavior)
- Manage state
- Usually "parents" of components
- Concerned with HOW things work
- Rarely have any HTML markup of their own

## Presentational Components or Dumb Components (How to Render the View)
- Don't manage state
- Usually "children" of components


**Props** and **state** of a **parent component** will become just **props** to their **child component**
